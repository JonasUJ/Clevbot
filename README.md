# Clevbot
A Discord bot that interacts with the cleverbot.com api

### Setup
You'll need a [Discord bot account](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) and a [Cleverbot](https://www.cleverbot.com/api/) api key.
Paste the information into `config.json` in the correct fields, then launch the bot and it should work.
